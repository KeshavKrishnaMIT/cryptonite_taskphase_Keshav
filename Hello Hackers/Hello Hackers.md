# Introduction To Commands

I just followed the outline given for the challenge, and it was very simple, after connecting the servers, just had to type hello.


# Intro To Arguments

Through this challenge I learnt that the first word in a line of text is the command whereas the followimg words are.
So here I entered hello hackers, hello being the command and hackers is the argument followed.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
