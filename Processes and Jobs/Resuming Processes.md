# Resuming Processes

```bash
 Connected!
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Let's practice resuming processes! Suspend me with Ctrl-Z, then resume me with
the 'fg' command! Or just press Enter to quit me!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
I'm back! Here's your flag:
pwn.college{0FWsEjYGT7pAv5cbts0-b1oC2ir.dZDN4QDLxMTO0czW}
Don't forget to press Enter to quit me!
```
This is fun, entered the command, ctrl+z, and then fg. All of it was very well explained in the challenge description.
