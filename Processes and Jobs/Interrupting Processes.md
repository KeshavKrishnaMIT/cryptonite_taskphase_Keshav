# Interrupting Processes

```bash
Connected!
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cUjbRWjWu8zE6huS0QYOgGx8HtJ.dNDN4QDLxMTO0czW}
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$
```

Easy challenge, just followed the description.
