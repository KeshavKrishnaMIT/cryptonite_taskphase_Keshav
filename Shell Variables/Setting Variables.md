# Setting Variables

Just followed the challenge description, nothing much to think.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Mk_yFKIoYZvqdn_8xInVBSunWaB.dlTN1QDLxMTO0czW}
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$
```
