# Reading Inputs
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "To set: " PWN
To set: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{E0xydg9Ibkv4axtj6orxmMOv2Pj.dhzN1QDLxMTO0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$
```

What do I say, either am too smart or the question was quite average, just had to read PWN and set it to COLLEGE, so followed the challenge description.
