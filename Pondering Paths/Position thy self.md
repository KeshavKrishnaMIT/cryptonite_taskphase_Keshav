# Position thy self

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/doc directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /usr/share/doc
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/doc$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k9TI9IS6ZvpZ4GOhrBicj7t9OL5.dZDN1QDLxMTO0czW}
```

I ran the command and then it told me to go to the other directory so I opened that and then again ran the commands.
