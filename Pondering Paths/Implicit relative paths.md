# Implicit relative paths, from/

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oEu50qpd4hbyzf9mbZa32RmfGzy.dlDN1QDLxMTO0czW}
```

It was told that a relative path does not start with a root(/) and the hint also said that the path starts with c, so I wrote thee command challenege/run without(/)
and it worked!!!!
